h1. Like Box

Attempts to store @LIKE@, @FOLLOW@, @HAPPEN@ (regular edge without properties) from and to different kinds of objects:

1. @Person LIKE Article@
2. @Person FOLLOW Person@
3. @Article HAPPEN Place@
4. @Person AROUND Place@ (probably also @CHECKIN@, with properties such as @created@, and @lat+long@)


h3. Extras

I also attempt to write 6 random generators for:

1. @Person@ vertices
2. @Article@ vertices
3. @Place@ vertices
3. @Person LIKE Article@ edges
4. @Person FOLLOW Person@ edges
5. @PersonCommentArticle@ stories
6. @PersonWallPerson@ stories


h3. TODO

1. @created@ property in LIKE, FOLLOW, HAPPEN, AROUND edges
1. Hyper-edges
2. Create domain objects using Ecore / EMF. Note: resulting domain objects should "just work" with Frames, spring Data mapping,
   and technologies such as JAX-RS, Jackson.
